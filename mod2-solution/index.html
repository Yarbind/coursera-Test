				<span id="beef">Beef</span>
				<p>Beef is prohibited in our country. we believe that all animals are not equals,thus we eat chicken and goats but forbade beefs as they come from superior domestic animals; and basically from cow genre. cow is worshipped here as pet of Goddess laxmi thus, thus it is against the country's rule.</p></section>

				<span id="sushi">Sushi</span>
				<p>I don't know what Sushi is, but I would like to taste if it's non-beef. I can readily accept if it's buff item. Sushi , as per name, might be a delicous recipe to put in mouth. If I ever come accross sushi then I will ask about it and probably would take one or more bit of it.</p></section>
